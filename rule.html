    <h2>Hosts</h2>
    <p>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is known for employing strong and talented hosts starting with Regis Philbin who hosted the original U.S version of the show from 1999 until 2002. In 2002 the show was syndicated and the updated version was hosted by Meredith Vieira for a whopping 11 seasons from September 2002 until May 2013. Cedric the Entertainer went on to host the 2013-14 season and was followed up by Terry Crews who hosted the show over the 2014-15 season.

        Currently the show is hosted by Chris Harrison who took over from Terry Crews and has been hosting Who Wants to Be a Millionaire since September 2015. Due to the show’s reputation for brilliant hosting, this job is certainly somewhat daunting for any newcomer. Thankfully Harrison is a seasoned professional and many will recognise him from his 13 seasons of hosting the smash-hit reality romance series ‘The Bachelor / Bachelorette’. Harrison also hosted all the Bachelor spin-offs such as ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ as well as ‘After Paradise’.
        
        In addition to his career as a world-famous reality romance host, Harrison has an impressive hosting résumé that includes: the ‘Emmys Red Carpet Live’, ‘American Music Awards Red Carpet Live!’ and the ‘Road to the 60th Primetime Emmy® Awards’, amongst others. He’s also been hosting ‘Miss America’ for a number of years.</p>
